<article style=""><h1>The benefit of what I do.</h1><p>Here’s a story about the Israeli Air Force that explains what we do. </p></article>

In the early 70's an American Air Force General visited Israel. Not only were the Israelis recognized as best in the world, at close-air support, they had managed to destroy nearly all of the Egyptian Air Force, while it was still on the ground, in the first 20 minutes of the Six Day War. In an era without GPS and network-centric warfare, clearly something amazing was going on. And the general wanted to know what it was.

For several days, the general saw planes and bases and formations and maps and planning rooms, but nothing he saw got him any closer to the answer he was seeking. So, while walking through a hanger, he stopped and turned to his host and said, "Enough."

"We have planes and hangers and pilots in the United States. Way more of them than you do. I don't need to see any more of them. What I need to see is the difference. What makes you guys so good?"

The Israeli general smiled, because some things are very hard to put into words, even if they are very simple. As he was searching for a way to explain it, he saw a janitor sweeping in the corner. He called him over and said, "Tell the general what you do."

Without hesitation the janitor said, "I kill the enemy and bring our pilots home safe."

The American general laughed, but quickly saw that this was not a joke. "C'mon," he said, "you're a janitor? You push a broom? How do you kill the enemy and save pilots?"

The janitor said, "I keep the hanger clean. So the engines don't get dirt in them and the mechanics have good place to work so they planes don't break down. The pilot flies them, kills the enemy and flies them back. Without me, that couldn't happen.

"And so too with mechanics and the men who fly the fuel trucks and the men who cook the food and those who do the planning. We kill the enemy and bring our pilots home safe. What else should an Air Force do?"
